If you're having trouble with `Electron Router DOM`, here are some common issues and solutions.

## Distribution

### A JavaScript error occurred in the main process -> Error: Cannot find module 'XXX'

The following solution is from [Electron Vite docs](https://electron-vite.org/guide/troubleshooting), but it's the same for most of the Electron apps:

Dependent modules are not packaged into the application. To solve this:
- If the related module is installed in `devDependencies`, please reinstall it in `dependencies`. This is because packaging tools (e.g. `electron-builder`, `electron-forge`) usually exclude modules in `devDependencies`.
- If you are using the `pnpm package manager`, youâ€™ll need to add a file `.npmrc` with `shamefully-hoist=true` in project root directory (in order for your dependencies to be bundled correctly). Also, you need to delete `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, then reinstall the modules. Of course you can switch to other package manager (e.g. `npm`, `yarn`) to avoid this problem.
