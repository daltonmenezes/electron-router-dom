description: Learn how to migrate from Electron Router DOM v1 to v2
---

<Steps>
  <Step>Updating dependencies</Step>

  ```shell
  npm i react-router-dom@latest electron-router-dom@latest
  ```

  Remember, the minimum versions required for `Electron Router DOM v2` are:
  - electron: **`>=17.0`**
  - react: **`>=18.0`**
  - react-router-dom: **`>=6.22.3`**

  <Step>Creating the `electron-router-dom.ts` file</Step>

  In the `src` folder of your project, create a `lib` folder and inside it the `electron-router-dom.ts` file.
  It is through this new file that you will expose the `registerRoute` method and the `Router` component to your application.

  <br/>

  - The <Link href="/docs/api/main/register-route">registerRoute</Link> method will be used in the `main process` to register a window as a route of the application.
  - The <Link href="/docs/api/renderer/router">Router</Link> component will be used in the `renderer process` to navigate between the windows/routes of the application.

  <br/>

  ```typescript title="src/lib/electron-router-dom.ts"
    import { createElectronRouter } from 'electron-router-dom'

    export const { Router, registerRoute } = createElectronRouter({
      port: 4927, // the port of your React server is running on (optional, default port is 3000)

      types: {
        /**
         * The ids of the windows of your application, think of these ids as the basenames of the routes
         * this new way will allow your editor's intelisense to help you know which ids are available to use
         * both in the main and renderer process
         */
        ids: ['main'],
      },
    })
  ```

  <Step>Updating the main process</Step>

  ```diff title="src/main/index.ts"
  - import { createFileRoute, createURLRoute } from 'electron-router-dom'
  + import { registerRoute } from '../lib/electron-router-dom'
  ```
  With the removal of the `createFileRoute` and `createURLRoute` functions from the `electron-router-dom` package, the process has become simpler and more intuitive.
  Now, you only need to import the `registerRoute` function from the `electron-router-dom.ts` file you created earlier.

  What was done this way before:

  ```ts title="src/main/index.ts"
    const devServerURL = createURLRoute('http://localhost:3000', id)

    const fileRoute = createFileRoute(
      join(__dirname, '../renderer/index.html'),
      id
    )

    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
      ? window.loadURL(devServerURL)
      : window.loadFile(...fileRoute)
  ```
  Now, it will be done like this:

  ```ts title="src/main/index.ts"
    registerRoute({
      id: 'main',
      browserWindow: window,
      htmlFile: path.join(__dirname, '../renderer/index.html'),
    })
  ```

  You no longer need to worry about the logic of loading the development server URL or the application HTML file, `Electron Router DOM` will take care of it for you.

  <Step>Updating imports in the rendering process</Step>

  Now the `Route` component is no longer exported from the `electron-router-dom` package, but from the `react-router-dom` package.
  In addition to simplifying the use of `Electron Router DOM`, this decision will help cause less confusion about what should be imported from each package.

  ```diff title="src/renderer/routes.tsx"
  + import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'

  - import { Router, Route } from 'electron-router-dom'
  + import { Router } from '../lib/electron-router-dom'
  ```
