The Context API with `Electron Router DOM` is pretty simple to use, but there are some caveats you need to be aware of!

The `Provider` must be used in the `element` prop, so you can't use it at the same level of a `Route`, because `React Router DOM` requires a` Route`, otherwise you will get the following error:

 <Alert variant="destructive" className="my-4">
  <AlertTitle>ðŸš« Error: [AppProvider] is not a `<Route>` component.</AlertTitle>

  <AlertDescription>
    All component children of `<Routes>` must be a `<Route>` or `<React.Fragment>`
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

### Example of right usage

```tsx {4, 6}
<Route
  path="/"
  element={
    <SomeProvider>
      <SomePage />
    </SomeProvider>
  }
/>
```

or you can just pass the `Router` as children of your `Provider`:

```tsx {1, 10}
<SomeProvider>
  <Router
    main={
      <Route
        path="/"
        element={<SomePage />}
      />
    }
  />
</SomeProvider>
```
