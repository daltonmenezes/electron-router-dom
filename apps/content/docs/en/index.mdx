description: A quick introduction to Electron Router DOM
---

If you've ever tried using the `react-router-dom` library with `Electron`,
you've probably had trouble getting it to work properly,
both in development and production environments.

From this, the `Electron Router DOM` library was born,
which aims to facilitate the integration of `react-router-dom` with `Electron` and window routing,
where each window can have its own routing.

## Features

- üöÄ Ready for production and development environments
- üì± Window routing support
- üåê Support for `query strings` sent from the main process to the renderer
- üß¨ Type-safe API designed to provide good DX

## Installation

In your terminal and in the root folder of your application, run:

```shell
npm i electron-router-dom
```

## Creating your first routing

  <AlertDescription>
    **Electron Router DOM** already manages the `loadURL` and `loadFile` methods of the `BrowserWindow` from **Electron**, to avoid issues, do not use them manually!
  </AlertDescription>

<Steps>
  <Step>Create the `electron-router-dom.ts` file</Step>

  In your project's `src` folder, create a `lib` folder and within it the `electron-router-dom.ts` (or `.js`) file.
  It is through this file that you will expose the `registerRoute` method and the `Router` component to your application.

  <br/>

  - The <Link href="/docs/api/main/register-route">registerRoute</Link> method will be used in the `main process` to register a window as an application route.
  - The <Link href="/docs/api/renderer/router">Router</Link> component will be used in the `renderer process` to navigate between the application's windows/routes.

  <br/>

  ```typescript title="src/lib/electron-router-dom.ts"
    import { createElectronRouter } from 'electron-router-dom'

    export const { Router, registerRoute } = createElectronRouter({
      port: 4927, // the port of your React server is running on (optional, default port is 3000)

      types: {
        /**
         * The ids of the windows of your application, think of these ids as the basenames of the routes
         * this new way will allow your editor's intelisense to help you know which ids are available to use
         * both in the main and renderer process
         */
        ids: ['main'],
      },
    })
  ```

  <Step>Update the main process</Step>

  Import the `registerRoute` method from the `electron-router-dom.ts` file you created earlier:

  ```ts title="src/main/index.ts"
    import { registerRoute } from '../lib/electron-router-dom'
  ```

  And in the function where you create your application window, after creation, register the route by passing your window to `registerRoute`:

  ```ts title="src/main/index.ts"
    registerRoute({
      id: 'main',
      browserWindow: window,
      htmlFile: path.join(__dirname, '../renderer/index.html'),
    })
  ```

  Note that you no longer need to worry about the logic of loading the development server URL or the application HTML file, the `Electron Router DOM` will take care of that for you.

  <Step>Update the renderer process</Step>

  Import the `Router` component from the `electron-router-dom.ts` file you created earlier:

  ```ts title="src/renderer/routes.tsx"
    import { Router } from '../lib/electron-router-dom'
  ```

  And with that you will need to pass your routes to the `Router` component, see an example:

  ```tsx title="src/renderer/routes.tsx"
    import { Router } from 'electron-router-dom'
    import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { MainScreen, AboutScreen, SearchScreen } from './screens'

    export function AppRoutes() {
      return (
        <Router
          main={
            <>
              <Route path="/" element={<MainScreen />} />
              <Route path="/search" element={<SearchScreen />} />
            </>
          }
          about={<Route path="/" element={<AboutScreen />} />}
        />
      )
    }
  ```
