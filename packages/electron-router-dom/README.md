If you've ever tried using the `react-router-dom` library with `Electron`,
you've probably had trouble getting it to work properly,
both in development and production environments.

From this, the `Electron Router DOM` library was born,
which aims to facilitate the integration of `react-router-dom` with `Electron` and window routing,
where each window can have its own routing.

# Features

- üöÄ Ready for production and development environments
- üì± Window routing support
- üåê Support for `query strings` sent from the main process to the renderer
- üß¨ Type-safe API designed to provide good DX

# Installation

> **Minimum required versions**
>
> - electron: >=17.0
> - react: >=18.0
> - react-router-dom: >=6.22.3

In your terminal and in the root folder of your application, run:

```bash
npm i electron-router-dom
```

**Router DOM is a peer dependency**, if you haven't installed it yet or your package manager won't handle it automatically for you, so run:

```bash
npm i react-router-dom
```
